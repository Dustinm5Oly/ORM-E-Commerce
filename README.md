## Description

* This application is to be able to add, update, check, and delete information from a database using mysql 2
* My motivation to create this app was to be able to understand how the backend works and utilize mysql2 to create a database that can be interacted with.
* I designed this app to allow myself to better understand how a database is structured and how to connect different tables to each other and display content.
* The application allows the user to alter, delete, add or view items within different tables inside of a database. 
* I was able to learn how to connect multiple tables together through mysql2 and allow user to alter the tables.
